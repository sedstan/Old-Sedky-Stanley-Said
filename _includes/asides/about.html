				<h3 class="mini-icon">About Me</h3>
				<p>Following university in 2006, I entered the working world as a full time retail employee and a part camera operator for the local government television station.</p>

<p>After  several years of working my way up to  entry-level management and foregoing a career in media, I had an epiphany - my wife!</p>

 <p>Upon arrival in the UK, it was decided that furthering my education was necessary to excel my career and technology has always been something I have been interested in.</p>

<p>During my time at General Assembly, I have learnt how to code and make web apps. As I continue  my development career, I am searching for an organisation that will allow me to carry on learning through an Agile environment and my new found passion- tech development!</p>
